1) if you want to build the liveness detector from scratch, you need to upload original dataset (LivDet15) to your Google Drive and then execute following notebooks:
  i- DataAugmentation, create patch dataset
  ii- ScannerTraining

2) if you want to build the liveness detector from scratch but you don't want create patches dataset:
  i- Upload dataset in MyDrive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e9-B7wlfSf5CNfZDsOfDP3Twj6rj46UU?usp=sharing
  ii- Execute notebook "ScannerTraining"

3) If you don't want to build the liveness detector from scratch, upload these datasets in "MyDrive":
  i- patches dataset in directory "Dataset_impronte": https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e9-B7wlfSf5CNfZDsOfDP3Twj6rj46UU?usp=sharing
  ii- weights network in directory "Scanner": https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kxUI3vim6O8ZFRw_ZvHPxaZgG0ulbdkE?usp=sharing
  
Finally, you can execute notebook in "examples"
