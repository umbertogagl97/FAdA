If you don't want to build the liveness detector from scratch, you need to upload the data to your Google Drive.
Follow links to data:
dataset fingerprint livdet: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e9-B7wlfSf5CNfZDsOfDP3Twj6rj46UU?usp=sharing
weights network: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kxUI3vim6O8ZFRw_ZvHPxaZgG0ulbdkE?usp=sharing

How to organize Google Drive?
-download directories: "Dataset_impronte" and "Scanner";
-insert directories in "MyDrive";

TODO: in Dataset_impronte/training/ sono presenti solo i dataset con patch, quindi bisogna caricare anche i dataset originali o inserire un altro link esterno
